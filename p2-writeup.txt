PROMPT 1 EVALUATION
Objectively, the BLEU scores for Prompt 1 are  low for both stories. For Story 1, the model-generated output repeats the Initial Sentence ("He missed his train to work and instead went to the park"), which does not overlap with any of the reference Edited Endings. Similarly, for Story 2, the output repeats the Initial Sentence ("Now he had worked his way south into Australia"), which also fails to match the references. These BLEU scores highlight the complete lack of alignment between the model’s outputs and the reference Edited Endings, suggesting that the prompt failed to guide the model in adapting the story endings based on the Counterfactual.
Subjectively, for Prompt 1, the outputs are still inaccurate in both stories. In Story 1, the Counterfactual indicates that Ryan had an important project at work and went in to finish it, but the output does not reflect this at all. Instead, it repeats the Initial Sentence, which is entirely unsuitable as an ending. This earns a score of 1/5. In Story 2, the Counterfactual mentions that Neil contracted malaria and had to be flown home, yet the output focuses on Neil continuing his journey south into Australia, ignoring the Counterfactual entirely. This response is equally inappropriate and also earns a 1/5. Overall, Prompt 1 does not guide the model to generate contextually relevant or logical endings.

PROMPT 2 EVALUATION
Objectively, the BLEU scores for Prompt 2 show slightly better performance for Story 1 but remain low for Story 2. For Story 1, the model-generated output is identical to the Original Ending ("Ryan and his friend played with birds at the park all day..."), which overlaps slightly with some parts of the reference Edited Endings. However, the low score indicates that most of the references expect a different narrative aligned with the Counterfactual, which the model fails to capture. In Story 2, the BLEU score reflects that the model-generated ending ("Neil was so excited to see Australian culture...") has no overlap with the references, as it completely ignores the Counterfactual.
Subjectively, Prompt 2 outputs are also inappropriate, though slightly better than Prompt 1 for Story 1. In Story 1, the model-generated output repeats the Original Ending without adapting to the Counterfactual about Ryan going to work to finish his project. While it provides a coherent and grammatically correct ending, it contradicts the Counterfactual, earning a 3/5 for being partially coherent but inappropriate. In Story 2, the output focuses on Neil’s excitement about Australian culture, ignoring the Counterfactual that he was flown home due to malaria. This creates a response that is nonsensical given the Counterfactual, earning a 1/5. While Prompt 2 performs slightly better for Story 1, it still fails to produce logical or contextually accurate endings overall.
